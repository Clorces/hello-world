# hello-world

I'm new to GitHub. I got very interested in Intel's Media SDK team's job presentation, so I'm now willing to join them to get better and help them reach their goals. I'm not very experienced in C++ and my projects are limited to simple university programs. Interested in Game Development, 3D Modeling and Animation.
